# Investing.com-Web-Scraper
Web Scraper that downloads both the top gainers and top losers in NYSE and Nasdaq at the markets open (9:30 EST).
Code can be modified without much hassle to get information from any of the tables on investing.com 

# How to use the code
To change the time at which the data is scraped, simply change all instances of 9:30 to whatever time you see fit
The Code automatically uploads into JSON format, to find it in your files just search for the document title stated in the Main Code
Two seperate JSON files are downloaded when code is run, one for the top losers and one for the top gainers
You must download libraries Pandas, Requests, and Beautiful Soup before code can run
The code will time out unless you put in additioal loop functions or mess with the terminal in other ways

# Request
I am happy for anyone to use this code as they please, all I ask is that you let me know how you use it
Also, feel free to let me know if you find any improvments or issues within the code itself
